SCOREWhile creating different types of animation in entertainment industry, animators try to visualize how an inanimate object would display each type of  human movement in its own simple way. When I was recording movement, I thought of similar movements but its difficult to capture these type of imaginary movements while performing motion capture. So, for my recording, I performed simple walking for approximately one and half minute. The movements were simple though not that simple.   I imagined a square and walked along the edges of the square. I also walked diagonally, in reverse direction and in slow motion.  While walking in forward direction, the speed of the movements was quite fast as our human brain regularly deals with these types of movements.Walking in reverse direction was simple as compared to walking with long steps(slow-motion) in horizontal direction. The tempo while recording these steps was slow as brain was trying to get acquainted with this type of movements. While walking with crossed legs was super fun and it had a great tempo.I was trying to recall many other movements while recording.
